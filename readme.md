# OneCart

OneCart is a simple application, built primarily as proof-of-concept for using Ionic to build a single Angular application for iOS and Android. 

OneCart uses Firebase's realtime database to allow different memebrs of the same household to share a list of categorized groceries, with instant updates to all devices as items are added or checked off. 

The app was available on the iOS Appstore at one point, but I stopped paying the $100 required to keep it up, so it is no longer there.

It is available at https://onecart-prod.web.app/, but is only optimized for mobile screen sizes.

## Built with
- [Angular 10](https://angular.io/)
- [Ionic 5](https://ionicframework.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)
